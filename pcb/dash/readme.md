# Software Archaeology: FutureNet Dash

I had heard of FutureNet, but had never used it.  It is mentioned as the
first schematic capture program usable for designing Xilinx FPGAs. 
Recently I discovered that a version is available:

"FutureNet DASH was a schematic capture program written for IBM DOS PCs
released in the early 1980s.  It was an extremely expensive package - over
$5000 at the time.  After passing through various hands the software was
released as version 6.10 in a de-restricted version."

This is from Contrelec, which hosts this final version:

There is a review of it in the October 1983 issue of PC Magazine.  This
article mentions some old "mainframe" electronic design pacakges I will have
to look into at some point:

Bitsavers has some brochures and a price-list, it sure was expensive:

There is no further documentation that I can find.  However, the program has
on-line help.  I've extracted it here:

[dash-online-help.md](dash-online-help.md)

The commands are organized by by function by prefix.  I grouped them
together here:
